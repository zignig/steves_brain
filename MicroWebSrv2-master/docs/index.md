# About

This project follows the embedded [MicroWebSrv](https://github.com/jczic/MicroWebSrv),
which is mainly used on microcontrollers such as Pycom, ESP32 and STM32 on Pyboards.

In a need for scalability and to meet the IoT universe, **microWebSrv2** was developed as a new project
and has been completely redesigned to be much more robust and efficient that its predecessor.

Internal mechanisms works **directly at I/O level**, are fully asynchronous from end to end, and manages the memory in a highly optimized way.  
Also, architecture makes its integration very easy and the source code, **MIT licensed**, remains really small.

# Features

- Embed **microWebSrv2** into your microcontrollers as a **powerful web server**.

- Benefit from a fully **asynchronous architecture** that allows to process many **concurrent requests** very quickly.

- Use multiple worker threads to **parallelize simultaneous processes**.

- Adjust settings to **fine-tune resources usage** and sizing pre-allocated memory.

- Load **additional modules** to extend the server's functionalities.

- Customize the management of **centralized logs**.

- Apply **SSL/TLS security layer** and certificate on web connections (https mode).

- Define **web routes** with variable arguments in order to be able to process the targeted requests.

- Receive any type of request such as ```GET```, ```HEAD```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, ```DELETE```, ```OPTIONS```, ```PATCH```, ...

- Use the **route resolver** (from the path) and the **path builder** (from the route) for convenience.

- Increase loading speed by automatically allowing web clients to **cache static files**.

- Receive name/value pairs from **URL encoded forms**.

- Send and receive **JSON** objects and use them to create a **RESTful API** style.

- Play with **AjAX** requests to interact quickly with a web application.

- Define the **origin** of resources and allow all values of **CORS** pre-flight requests.

- Verify that a request is successfully **authenticated** by the **Basic** or **Bearer** method.

- Reduce the number of persistent connections per web client with **keep-alive mode** support.

- Respond to a request by using a **data stream** as content, sent with known length or in **chunked transfer-encoding**.

- Use a file to respond to a request that will be treated as **on-the-fly content** or as an **attachment to download**.

- Take advantage of the **WebSockets module** to exchange messages in real time via **WS or secured WSS** connection.

- Create **.pyhtml pages** for an HTML rendering with integrated Python using the **PyhtmlTemplate module**.

  - ## MicroWebSrv2 package

    The Python package comes with the following files:
      - **/MicroWebSrv2**
        - \_\_init\_\_.py
        - microWebSrv2.py
        - webRoute.py
        - httpRequest.py
        - httpResponse.py
        - **/libs**
          - XAsyncSockets.py
          - urlUtils.py
        - **/mods**
          - WebSockets.py
          - PyhtmlTemplate.py

    ---

  <a name="working-with-mws2"></a>
  - ## Working with microWebSrv2

    To work with **microWebSrv2**, you must first import the package as follows:
    ```python
    from MicroWebSrv2 import *
    ```

    There are 5 main elements with which you will work:
      - Web server (see [MicroWebSrv2 class](#mws2-class))
      - Routes (see [Web routes](#web-routes))
      - Requests (see [HttpRequest class](#request-class))
      - Responses (see [HttpResponse class](#response-class))
      - Modules (see [Additional modules](#modules))

    Now, you have everything you need to continue :')

    ---

    <a name="async-logic"></a>
    - ### Asynchronous logic

      **microWebSrv2** is based on a fully asynchronous I/Os logic.

      This means that many requests and responses can be processed concurrently,
      allowing other necessary processing at any time within a single thread.

      In addition, it is possible to use several shared workers in order to
      be able to parallelize processes that could be blocking.

      Finally, memory buffers required for data processing are pre-allocated
      as best as possible to maximize performance and prevent excessive memory requirements.

      Thus, it is possible to maintain several thousand persistent connections but also,
      to benefit from a low consumption of resources on embedded platforms.

      > **microWebSrv2** leans on the [XAsyncSockets](#xasyncsockets) layer.

    <a name="config-web-srv"></a>
    - ### Configuring web server

      Before starting **microWebSrv2** to listen to web requests, it is important to configure it correctly.

        - If you want to change the default server port or bind IP address, you must set the **BindAddress** property.
          ```python
          mws2.BindAddress = ('192.168.0.1', 12345)
          ```

        - If you want to define an another directory for web files, you must set the **RootPath** property.
          ```python
          mws2.RootPath = 'webfiles/root'
          ```

        - If you want a secure https web server, you must call the [**EnableSSL**](#mws2-enablessl) method.
          ```python
          mws2.EnableSSL(certFile='certificate.crt', keyFile='private-key.key')
          ```

        - If you want to redirect resources not found, you must set the **NotFoundURL** property.
          ```python
          mws2.NotFoundURL = '/'   # relative or absolute URL
          ```

        - If you want to set a pre-configured setting, you can call one of the following methods:
            - [SetEmbeddedConfig](#mws2-setembeddedconfig)
            - [SetLightConfig](#mws2-setlightconfig)
            - [SetNormalConfig](#mws2-setnormalconfig) (default setting)
            - [SetLargeConfig](#mws2-setlargeconfig)

        - If you want to set your custom settings, you can adjust the following properties:
            - [ConnQueueCapacity](#mws2-prop)
            - [BufferSlotsCount](#mws2-prop)
            - [BufferSlotSize](#mws2-prop)
            - [KeepAllocBufferSlots](#mws2-prop)
            - [MaxRequestContentLength](#mws2-prop)

        - If you want to change the default timeout to wait for requests data, you must set the **RequestsTimeoutSec** property.
          ```python
          mws2.RequestsTimeoutSec = 10
          ```

        - If you want to intercept logs to process them, you must set the [**OnLogging**](#mws2-onlogging) callback.
          ```python
          def OnMWS2Logging(microWebSrv2, msg, msgType) :
              print('Log from custom function: %s' % msg)

          mws2.OnLogging = OnMWS2Logging
          ```

      ---

      <a name="default-pages"></a>
      - ### Default pages

        Default pages are used as resources when requested paths point to directories.

        | Page filename |
        |---------------|
        | index.html    |
        | index.htm     |
        | default.html  |
        | default.htm   |

        > It is possible to add new default pages globally by calling [**MicroWebSrv2.AddDefaultPage**](#mws2-adddefaultpage) static method.

        ---

      <a name="mime-types"></a>
      - ### MIME types

        MIME types allow specific files as readable resources and that are transmitted with the corresponding content type.

        | Filename extension | MIME type |
        |--------------------|------------------------|
        | .txt               | text/plain             |
        | .htm               | text/html              |

    <a name="start-web-srv"></a>
    - ### Starting web server

      To start **microWebSrv2** server, you must use one of the following methods:

        - **Start in a pool:**  
          The web server uses an existing asynchronous pool.  
          If you want to have more than one server, this is the right solution.  
          > For more documentation, see [**StartInPool(...)**](#mws2-startinpool) method.  
          > If you want details about pools, check the GitHub repository of [XAsyncSockets](https://github.com/jczic/XAsyncSockets) library.

        - **Start in a managed pool:**  
          The web server automatically creates a new managed asynchronous pool and uses it.  
          If you only need one server without more specific code, this is the right solution.  
          However, you will need to define some pool sizing parameters.  
          In this mode, a call to ```mws2.Stop()``` will release the pool.  
          > For more documentation, see [**StartManaged(...)**](#mws2-startmanaged) method.

      Example to start a dual http/https web server:
      ```python
      from MicroWebSrv2 import *
      from time         import sleep

      xasPool  = XAsyncSocketsPool()
      srvHttp  = MicroWebSrv2()
      srvHttps = MicroWebSrv2()

      srvHttps.EnableSSL( certFile = 'SSL-Cert/openhc2.crt',
                          keyFile  = 'SSL-Cert/openhc2.key' )

      srvHttp .StartInPool(xasPool)
      srvHttps.StartInPool(xasPool)
      
      xasPool.AsyncWaitEvents(threadsCount=1)

      try :
          while True :
              sleep(1)
      except KeyboardInterrupt :
          srvHttp .Stop()
          srvHttps.Stop()
          xasPool .StopWaitEvents()
      ```

      ---

    <a name="handling-routes"></a>
    - ### Handling web routes

      **microWebSrv2** have an easy and efficient web route system.  
      A simple handler function with a decorator allows you to process requests.

      Example of a processing handler:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(GET, '/test')
      def RequestTest(microWebSrv2, request) :
          request.Response.ReturnOkJSON({
              'ClientAddr' : request.UserAddress,
              'Accept'     : request.Accept,
              'UserAgent'  : request.UserAgent
          })
      ```
      > For more documentation, see [**Web Routes**](#web-routes) section.

      ---

    <a name="ssl-security"></a>
    - ### SSL/TLS security (HTTPS)

      **microWebSrv2** allow web server to apply the SSL/TLS security layer.  
      In this case, a certificate and its private key must be given (with an optional PEM file).

      If you want to test https mode, uncomment the ```mws2.EnableSSL(...)``` call in ```main.py``` file.  
      After restarting the demo program, open your browser at the following address:  
      [https://localhost](https://localhost)

      The **ssl library** must be implements ```SSLContext``` on Python version to support secured web server.

  <a name="xasyncsockets"></a>
  - ## About XAsyncSockets layer

    **XAsyncSockets** is an efficient Python/MicroPython library of managed asynchronous sockets.  
    > Available under MIT license on GitHub (same author):  
      [https://github.com/jczic/XAsyncSockets](https://github.com/jczic/XAsyncSockets)

    **XAsyncSockets** layer provides the following features:
      - Managed asynchronous sockets in a pool (up to thousands!)
      - Works directly with I/O to receive and send very quickly
      - Supports very large number of simultaneous TCP connections
      - Supports concurrent synchronous processing operations if necessary (threaded)
      - Implementation of TCP servers
      - Implementation of TCP clients
      - Implementation of UDP datagrams (sender and/or receiver)
      - TCP client can event after a specified size of data or a text line received
      - Each connections and receivings can waiting during a specified time
      - The reasons of TCP client closures are returned
      - Really robust, very fast and easy to use
      - Compatible with MicroPython implementation (sockets layer, FiFo queue, perf counter)

  <a name="web-routes"></a>
  - ## Web Routes

    Web routes allow you to define conditional access paths to
    specific resources and react to corresponding http requests.  
    They also provide the possibility of using freer
    conditions that can be retrieved as input elements.

    In **microWebSrv2**, a web route is composed by a **processing handler**,
    a **requested method**, a **requested path** and an optional **name**.  
    The requested path can also consist of variable parts that
    can be retrieved as arguments.

    Finally, during an http request, if the method and path match to a route,
    the processing handler is called with the expected arguments.

    ---

    <a name="route-process"></a>
    - ### Route Processing

      A route processing is an handler function decorated by the setting of the route.  
      This setting uses the ```@WebRoute``` decorator whose definition is as follows:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(method, routePath, name=None)
      # <method> is the http requested method and must be a not empty string.
      # <routePath> is the http requested path and must be a not empty string.
      # <name> is an optional route name and must be a string or None.
      ```

      The handler function definition is as follows:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(...)
      def RequestHandler(microWebSrv2, request)
      # <microWebSrv2> is of type MicroWebSrv2
      # <request> is of type HttpRequest
      ```

      The **method argument** can be a string but also one of the following constants:  
      ```GET```, ```HEAD```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, ```DELETE```, ```OPTIONS```, ```PATCH```

      The **routePath argument** must always starts by ```/``` and specifies the relative URL of the route.

      > Note that a route processing handler is **global** and can be called by any instance of MicroWebSrv2 class.

      Example of processing handlers:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(GET, '/my-resource')
      def RequestHandler1(microWebSrv2, request) :
          pass
      ```
      ```python
      @WebRoute(POST, '/test/virtual-page.html', 'myTestRoute')
      def RequestHandler2(microWebSrv2, request) :
          pass
      ```
      ```python
      @WebRoute(OPTIONS, '/')
      def RequestHandler3(microWebSrv2, request) :
          pass
      ```

      ---

    <a name="route-args"></a>
    - ### Route Arguments

      It is possible to include route arguments that can be retrieved as input elements.  
      These arguments are directly defined in the **requested path**
      by naming and framing them with ```<```and ```>``` as follows:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(GET, '/users/<id>/profile/<property>')
      ```
      In this web route, two arguments are defined: ```id``` and ```property```.  
      Thus, the route is variable and corresponds to the **requested path** from which any argument can be used.
      ```python
      '/users/123/profile/firstname'
      ```

      So, the handler function definition is extended as follows:
      ```python
      @WebRoute(...)
      def RequestHandler(microWebSrv2, request, args)
      # <microWebSrv2> is of type MicroWebSrv2
      # <request> is of type HttpRequest
      # <args> is a dictionary of route arguments
      ```
      Now, ```args``` can be used like ```args['id']``` or ```args['property']```.  
      Note that values can be strings but also integers directly.

    - ### Route Methods

      #### RegisterRoute(...)
      ```python
      def RegisterRoute(handler, method, routePath, name=None)
      # Registers a global web route directly, without decorator usage.
      #   - No return value.
      #   - <handler> is the route processing handler and must be a function (see above).
      #   - <method> is the http requested method and must be a not empty string.
      #   - <routePath> is the http requested path and must be a not empty string.
      #   - <name> is an optional route name and must be a string or None.
      # An exception can be raised if arguments are not correct.
      ```

      #### ResolveRoute(...)
      ```python
      def ResolveRoute(method, path)
      # Resolves a web route using a method and a path.
      #   - Returns a RouteResult class if no error occurred and route was found, returns None otherwise.
      #   - <method> is an http method and must be of string type.
      #   - <path> is an http relative path and must be of string type.
      ```
      The **RouteResult** class exposes the following properties:

      | Name        |        Type        |
      |-------------|:------------------:|
      | `Handler`   | processing handler |
      | `Method`    |       string       |
      | `RoutePath` |       string       |
      | `Name`      |   string or None   |
      | `Args`      |     dictionary     |

      #### PathFromRoute(...)
      ```python
      def PathFromRoute(routeName, routeArgs={ })
      # Constructs the relative path from the route name and route arguments.
      #   - Returns a string that is the relative path.
      #   - <routeName> is the name of the web route and must be a not empty string.
      #   - <routeArgs> is a dictionary of needed argument names and values.
      # An exception can be raised if arguments are not correct or route was not found.
      ```

  <a name="modules"></a>
  - ## Additional modules

    **microWebSrv2** supports additional modules that can be called during the
    processing of a web request and can then decide whether or not to intercept it.  
    Modules can simply analyze http requests or responding to them so that
    they cannot continue their normal pipe-line processing.

    A module file must be placed in the "```/mods```" directory of the package
    and must define a class of the same name.  
    In addition, this class must implement the ```OnRequest(...)``` method
    that will be called at each http request.

    Example of a module named "```TestMod.py```":
    ```python
    class TestMod :

        def OnRequest(self, microWebSrv2, request) :
            print('TestMod: Request received from %s:%s' % request.UserAddress)
    ```

    <a name="websockets-mod"></a>
    - ## WebSockets Module

      **WebSockets module** must be loaded first by **microWebSrv2** to process WebSocket connections.  
      These are fully managed asynchronous I/Os and really many connections can be processed.  
      After module loaded, do not forget to assign the callback [OnWebSocketAccepted](#ws-mod-onwebsocketaccepted).  
      If you need to select and process a sub-protocol, you must assign the callback [OnWebSocketProtocol](#ws-mod-onwebsocketprotocol).  
      ```python
      from MicroWebSrv2 import *

      WS_CHAT_SUB_PROTOCOL = 'myGreatChat-v1'

      def OnWebSocketProtocol(microWebSrv2, protocols) :
          if WS_CHAT_SUB_PROTOCOL in protocols :
              return WS_CHAT_SUB_PROTOCOL

      def OnWebSocketAccepted(microWebSrv2, webSocket) :
          print('New WebSocket (myGreatChat proto) accepted from %s:%s.' % webSocket.Request.UserAddress)

      wsMod = MicroWebSrv2.LoadModule('WebSockets')
      wsMod.OnWebSocketProtocol = OnWebSocketProtocol
      wsMod.OnWebSocketAccepted = OnWebSocketAccepted
      ```

      - ### WebSocket Class

        WebSocket class is automatically instantiated by WebSockets module.  
        A WebSocket can be obtained when a new connection is accepted in the callback [OnWebSocketAccepted](#ws-mod-onwebsocketaccepted).  
        It is also important to assign WebSocket callbacks in order to receive the various events.

    - ## PyhtmlTemplate Module

      **PyhtmlTemplate module** must be loaded first by **microWebSrv2** to process **.pyhtml** pages.  
      With it, you will be able to render HTML pages directly integrating Python/MicroPython language.  
      ```python
      from MicroWebSrv2 import *

      pyhtmlTemplateMod = MicroWebSrv2.LoadModule('PyhtmlTemplate')
      pyhtmlTemplateMod.ShowDebug = True
      ```

      In the pages **.pyhtml**, you must use special instructions:  
      Please, consult the **[documentation](https://github.com/jczic/MicroWebSrv2#pyhtmltemplate-mod)** on the GitHub project page.

      See the **[test.pyhtml](https://github.com/jczic/MicroWebSrv2/blob/master/www/test.pyhtml)** page for an example.
